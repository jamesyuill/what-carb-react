# What Carb Frontend

Built in React, this incredibly cliche recipe app/dish suggester was an original idea before attending the Northcoders Software Development Bootcamp.

Before, it was a single html page, (having not learned about the joys of frameworks).

I retrieved the data from a json file and imported it directly into my main.js file.

As I didn't know better, there were a tonne of DOM manipulations going on and the header and footer of the main.js file was take up with an uncredible amount of getElementByIds and addEventListeners.

I first built the backend which can be found here - https://github.com/jamesyuill/what-carb-be

After making sure I was getting served all the write information and could do any CRUD operation I desired, I began building the front end.

Initially, I wanted to get all the functionality running before worrying about styling, even so, I always viewed the app within a mobile simulator.

This helped when I did decide to start styling as mostly everything was in the right place.

The live project can be fount here - https://what-carb.netlify.app/

*please bear in mind that the backend winds down and takes a considerable amount of time to return with it's first ping on waking*

Feel free to clone this repo and run 'npm install' once you have 'cd'd into the folder.
